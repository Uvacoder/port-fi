lead: <strong>I like to design experiences on the web</strong>. From user research to visual design, to project management, to production-level frontend design work, I do this job with commitment and passion.

<p>
  Working on the web gives me the opportunity to deal with many technologies every day. 
  It's one of the perks of it. Our work as digital designers is strongly influenced by technologies that we use.  
</p>

<p>
  Over the years I have developed a remarkable skill in the design of digital publishing products. 
  I like working with news because I think they're the most precious resource on the web. 
  I followed projects for major publishing groups in Italy as GEDI, Netaddiction and Citynews.
