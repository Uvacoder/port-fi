If you’re into product design, [Design Notes](https://www.designnotes.co) is a library that will be a useful timesaver. It currently links to a lot of design resources (334 and counting) that you can filter according to the topic you’re looking for: from resources related to **user experience** to **design** and **prototyping tools**.

If you're looking for a place to start, there you found it.
