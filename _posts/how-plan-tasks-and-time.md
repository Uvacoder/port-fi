Finding the time for side projects is hard, whatever they are: write on your blog, collaborate to a newsletter, build a open-source project and so on.

I've to be honest: I really envy all those people who manage to do it systematically. How can they deal with all these thing, plus work/life things?

I tried a lot of workflows but they all fail.

After so many unsuccessful attempts, I've perhaps finally found a model for organizing activities and finding time slots every week.
