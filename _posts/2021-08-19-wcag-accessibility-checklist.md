Designing products that are both usable and accessible to most users requires that you go beyond the A level and focus on meeting AA or AAA contrast requirements.

To help you to get started, you could take a look to this [checklist](https://kma.global/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/WCAG_2.1_Checklist.pdf)

This checklist is a practical resource guide for experienced accessibility professionals and for those newer to the industry. 

The first part is a primer of industry nomenclature and accessibility testing approaches. Fillable and printable checklists follow. 

For even more ease, you can download the [Stark plugin](https://www.getstark.co/) via Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch to make sure that your designs pass either of the AA or AAA levels with full confidence before handing off your work.
