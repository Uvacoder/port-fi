After almost 10 years I'm leaving Citynews.

It wasn't an easy choice at all. As my friend Emanuela told me: *"Closing a chapter is hard as starting a new one"*.

My relationship with Citynews started in 2012 as freelance designer. I get hired to redesign their brands websites and community. Then, in 2015 they called me back to develop a responsive design strategy and renew the brand identity for all editorial products.

In April 2016 I permanently joined the company as Head of Design.

Looking back at my time there, I can't believe how much was done. Here are some highlights:

* Directed the **Product Design team**  working with and training lovable and skilled people that followed (and tolerated!) me over all these years
* Created a **modern, solid workflow** together with other departments and teams, using new tools and methologies
* Designed the **Citynews Global Design Language (GDL)**, a Design System that aims to create great experiences for all corporate brands
* Launched the redesign of both **CMS** and **CRM** internal tools, designed together with users from all departments
* Designed both **iOS** and **Android mobile apps**, (from v1.0.0 to v6.0.0)
* Developed a **Responsive Design Strategy**, reviewing design, front-end and development workflows
* Released the **new corporate website** in 2018
* Created a coherent, flexible and scalable **visual identity** for all Citynews brands
* Designed and developed a **front-end framework** from scratch, using technologies such as Nunjucks, Git, Gulp, Node.js and Fractal

Now that I'm almost 40, this amazing journey at Citynews ends and I'm ready to start a new chapter. In March of 2021, I was presented with an incredible opportunity. So good to my career and family that I couldnâ€™t say no.

I'm happy to share that in late May I'll join **HCL Technologies** â€Š-â€Š a global technology company that recently <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2018-12-06-HCL-Technologies-to-Acquire-Select-IBM-Software-Products-for-1-8B" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">acquired selected IBM Software Products and operates in over 50 countries</a> â€Š-â€Š as **Senior User Experience Designer** to help product owners, software engineers and customers to create and optimize the user experience of products.

Itâ€™s a huge step for my career and Iâ€™m really thrilled to start ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
