We all know the importance of the 10 usability heuristics. [In this interesting post](https://uxdesign.cc/nielsens-10-usability-heuristics-illustrated-by-revolut-s-solutions-a11ef94f65fd) published by UX Collective publication on Medium we can see for each of them a common use case illustrated by Revolut.

Sometimes it is difficult to combine theory and practice. Many struggle to understand how to put them into practice. Having a visual example can make the task easier.
