Last week I released the new [Typesmith v2.0.0](https://github.com/zetareticoli/typesmith/releases/tag/v2.0.0).

**Typesmith** is a responsive typography library built in Sass. 

Itâ€™s my first open-source project. I created it working on the **editorial** products for Citynews.  So, itâ€™s designed for this **purpose**. If you have a **blog, magazine, news website** or whatever you could find it very useful., it uses `px` as unit measure because I usually design in pixels. Any conversion to relative units comes next with the `@rem` Sass function.

## How it works
Typesmith is made up of a few essentials:
1. a Sass map to manage typography sizes
2. a Sass mixin that uses the map for `font-size` and `line-height` CSS declarations
3. a list of CSS classes for direct use in HTML templates (optional)

### Type Sizes
I chose classic English speaking world names: *Canon*, *Double Pica*, *Paragon* and more.

I think having a unique name for a specific size helps communication between designers and devs implementing a design. Like design tokens do.

## Customizations
Thereâ€™re some things you can customize:
* Control Vertical Rhythm wit CSS Custom Properties
* Change media-query Breakpoints
* Enable or Disable CSS classes

## Whatâ€™s next
I'm working on some nice feature for the future:
- Different Type Scales
- Relative units (like `vmin` or `vmax`)

ðŸ˜Ž Stay tuned!
