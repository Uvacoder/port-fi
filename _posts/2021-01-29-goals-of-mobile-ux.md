Mobile User Experience falls into the following categories:

1. Easy to use
2. Easy to learn
3. Satisfying
4. Friction free

Let's cover each one of these.

## Easy to use
So, easy to use -- users know where controls are. Discoverability is reduced, so that goes along with knowing where controls are. Discoverability describes looking for stuff -- "Do I have to look to find where controls are? Do I know how to navigate?" for example.



No understanding is required, you don’t have to know the rule, not have to think.
Features are where users expect them to be
Users feel in control

EXAMPLE SCREEN

## Easy to learn
Users can find their way over time
Users remember shortcuts, rules, routines
Learning curve is reduced, confusion minimized

## Satifying
Produces loyalty behavior
Users enjoy using it
Users look forward to it
You can produce loyalty and joy of use > emotional metric, emotional level of design. We want users to have smile on their face.
Reduce amount the stress
Users are gravitating only around 3/4 apps (business insider research)
Affects user emotions and satisfaction

## Avoiding interface friction
Every cognitive interruption to flow to rhythm and establishing a bond with the user adds friction.
Cooper: Cognitive friction is “the resistance encountered by human intellect when it engages with a complex system of rules”
Example: reduce amount of scroll on mobile interfaces
Avoid users to stop and go. Keep the flow: flow is designed as that continuous interaction where the user doesn0t have to stop thinking about

## Five mobile best practices
1. Clean layout -  to support visible and intuitive controls,  visible back button, visible navigation, visible icons (information should be clear)
2. Clear tasks
3. Navigation - intuitive, users know exactly where they are at a glance
4. Highly visual element - because users use apps in a complicated context, doing some other things
5. control - giving the user control at all times in an enviroment where sometimes they feel out of it because they’re on the move

## Rules
1. Context is key - in the dark, with one hand, with different fingers size - don’t assume all users can see gray on white background - different visual ability, different levels of technical familiarity 
2. Fat fingers friendly always - 44px sizes
