Last week I published [CSSUI](https://www.cssui.dev), a library of interactive components in pure CSS 🎉🎉🎉

The idea behind this project was pretty clear to me since the start: create a **library** of the most used **interactive components withour any Javascript at all**. 

Remember the jQueryUI components? 

Well, I took that list and re-created it in pure CSS. 
## Components

A list of available components included in this release:
- <a href="https://www.cssui.dev/docs/components/accordion/" taget="_blank">Accordion</a>
- <a href="https://www.cssui.dev/docs/components/dropdown/" taget="_blank">Dropdown</a>
- <a href="https://www.cssui.dev/docs/components/modal/" taget="_blank">Modal</a>
- <a href="https://www.cssui.dev/docs/components/tabs/" taget="_blank">Tabs</a>
- <a href="https://www.cssui.dev/docs/components/tooltip/" taget="_blank">Tooltip</a>
- <a href="https://www.cssui.dev/docs/components/slideout/" taget="_blank">Slideout</a>

For any of these you get both the HTML template and the CSS file. Just simple as that. 🙂

New components are in the roadmap and I plan to release them very soon.

## Agnostic Approach

I focused my work on making it as *"agnostic"* as possibile. No CSS classes are used to style elements. **No naming conventions** to rely on.

Yout can [customize components](https://www.cssui.dev/docs/getting-started/customize/) using **CSS Variables** or apply your own classes depending on project's architecture.

## Why to use CSSUI

Use CSSUI to **quickly design and build interactive components** without any additional scripts. You haven't to reinvent the wheel to create a modal or a dropdown. Just use pure HTML and CSS. 
 
It isn't a framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind. You can't build an entire website with it. 
## What's next

The very first release [v0.1.0](https://github.com/zetareticoli/cssui/releases/tag/v0.1.0) was published a week ago but many other updates will follow.

I work on this project in my spare time so there isn't a structured release planning. But, I just get some great feedback and interest. 

[Omar](https://github.com/omaxel) just joined the project as collaborator. I'm pretty excited about what we're planning to do in the next weeks. Stay tuned 😎
