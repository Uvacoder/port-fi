For the past 15 years, Iâ€™ve worked as a designer making brands and interfaces. I have had the pleasure of collaborating for companies like Doralab, Inarea, Shinyfrog, Comtaste, Seejay (and more) following clients such **Ferrari**, **Enel**, **ING Direct**, **Noema Life**, **Dondup**.

Now I'm **head of design** at [Citynews](https://www.citynews.it), a major digital publisher here in Italy.

Back in 2010 I fouded **Robodomain** with my friend [@weppos](https://www.simonecarletti.com), a software company focused on domains management tools. In 2013 **DNSimple** acquired and integrated the software in their product suite. It was such a exciting, difficult but beautiful experience.

Occasionally I write and talk about design methodologies, workflow and tools at conferences and events. I'm lecturer at **UXUniversity** having a [full-day workshop](https://www.uxuniversity.it/11/c_13/design-systems) about **Design Systems and Atomic Design**.
