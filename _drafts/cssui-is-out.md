Last week I published [CSSUI](https://www.cssui.dev), a library of interactive components in pure CSS ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

The idea behind this project, which I worked in summer's spare time, is pretty clear: create a set of most used interactive components withou any Javascript at all.

It isn't another Bootstrap, Bulma or Tailwind. You can't build an entire website with it. I love to think it's some kind of jQueryUI but in pure CSS and HTML.

I published the first release [v0.1.0](https://github.com/zetareticoli/cssui/releases/tag/v0.1.0) on 16th september but many other updates will follow. Plus, Omar Moscatello just joined the project to collaborate with me. I'm pretty excited about what we're planning to do in the next weeks. Stay tuned ðŸ˜Ž
